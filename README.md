# Network Security Experiments

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to explore and experiment with various network security concepts. These scripts provide hands-on examples of common network security tools and techniques.

## Features

- **Traceroute**: Map the path of packets between two hosts to visualize network routes.
- **DNS Server**: Implement a basic DNS server to understand domain name resolution.
- **DNS Tunneling**: Create a covert channel using malformed DNS packets for data transmission.
- **ARP Spoofing Simulation**: Simulate an ARP spoofing attack to understand how attackers can intercept network traffic.
- **TCP Hijacking Demonstration**: Demonstrate the process of hijacking a TCP session between two hosts (for educational purposes only).

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3** (Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Scapy** (Install using `pip install scapy`)
- A network interface with internet connectivity (Docker image)

## Disclaimer

These scripts are for educational purposes only. Use them responsibly and only on your own networks or with explicit permission from network administrators. **Performing these attacks on live networks without authorization is illegal and unethical**.

## Learning Resources

- Explore online courses and tutorials on network security.
- Read books and articles on network protocols and security vulnerabilities.

Enjoy experimenting with these network security tools!

> **Note**: These scripts may require further configuration depending on your specific network setup. Refer to the script documentation (if available) for detailed instructions.
